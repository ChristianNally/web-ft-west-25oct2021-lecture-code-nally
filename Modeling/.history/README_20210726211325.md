# ... And you thought you were only learning about Web Programming

# Physics, Computers and Math (Oh My!)

Computers are good at a few things:

1. repetative tasks
1. storing and retrieving data
1. performing calculations quickly
1. creating digital graphical displays that represent data

Notice that all of these points are important for web development, but they're ALSO important for things like making computational models of physical reality.

# Computers can be a 'time machine' of sorts
