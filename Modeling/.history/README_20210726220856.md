# Physics, Computers and Math (Oh My!)

Today, I'm here to deliver a pitch, an ask, a request, a hope, ... that as you continue your journey into computing, that you'll keep an open mind, a sharp eye out, for all of the consequences of the power that these tools give you.

As a student of physics and of history, I learned at a young age that 'high tech' tools and inventions can be used for both good and evil, and that sometimes your first inclination for the use of a tool or invention has unexpected consequences.

In the 1940's, it was discovered that you could create a runaway chain reaction of nuclear fission, leading to the 'atom bomb', which changed the nature of large scale human conflict forever, for better and for worse.

In the early 2004, Facebook was launched which ultimately displaced television as the thing that sucked up vast amounts of human 'down time' through psychological UX tricks of addictive, instantaneous, dopamine delivering minimalist social interactions and continuous calls to action. Facebook, the corporation, now literally (in the original sense of that word) owns a significant fraction of all of public discourse.

Today, humans are on the threshold of several new transformative technologies, including cryptocurrencies and machine learning, among others. These things have their powerful upsides, but also hold the potential to do a lot of harm, to human well-being as well as to the environment that sustains all of ecology.

Computers are good at a few things:

1. repetative tasks
1. storing and retrieving data
1. performing calculations quickly
1. creating digital graphical displays that represent data

Note that all of these points are important for web development, but they're ALSO important for making simulations ('computational models') of physical reality.

# Computers can be a 'time machine' of sorts

time machine; a machine capable of transporting a person backward or forward in time.

Javascript has a built-in feature that can be used to help with tracking and reacting to events at certain times: The Event Loop, used in asynchronous code.

We can leverage that Event Loop to simplify keeping track of when updates to our simulated system should occur.

# So... let us embark on the creation of a web app that can simulate a toy 'solar system'
